        <h2 class="hm-about-text">Background</h2>
        <h2 class="about-text5"> 
        My journey into holistic medicine began over a decade ago when I was first employed by a naturopathic medical provider as a front office administrator. At that time my life changed in the direction of Eastern medicine.
        <br><br>
        Since those early career moments, I have enrolled in massage therapy school, worked as a co-founder for a behavioral health startup, and most recently was employed as a front office administrator for an acupuncturist office.
        <br><br>
        I believe myself to be sensitive to softer, inner, energies, and that sensitivity has pushed me in the direction of biodynamic cranial sacral therapy. It has become my passion. I am currently six months away from completing a three year certification program, and I would be grateful for the opportunity to develop my practice with you.</h2>

        <h2 class="hm-about-text">Practice Philosophy</h2>
        <h2 class="about-text5"> 
        My intent is to create an environment where you feel comfortable, safe, and welcomed. During sessions, we will always move at a pace where you feel comfortable. I make it a point to always ask before moving forward with any tactile touch. I periodically check in with patients throughout sessions.
        <br> <br>
        Sessions are held at my home. Before and after each session, I wipe down common areas. To prepare the session room, I typically burn palo santos, sweetgrass, or non-scented candles (depending on your preference) before each session.
        <br> <br>
        If there are any special requests to make you feel more comfortable or safe, I will do my best to accommodate them.</h2>

        As a practitioner, I welcome any and all feedback. If things didnâ€™t go quite as you would have liked, I will do my best to incorporate the feedback into future sessions.</h2>
