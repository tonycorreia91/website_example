        <h2 class="about-text5"> 
        CranioSacral Therapy (CST) came into practice in the 1970s by Mr John Upledger. At that time, Mr Upledger brought the practice out from the field of Osteopathy and into the hands of physical therapists.<sup>1</sup>
        <br> <br>
        Traditional craniosacral therapy works by applying gentle, hand-on touch to the skull. Biodyanimic craniosacral therapy is considered the gentlest form of craniosacral therapy because the focus is on the energies moving throughout the body and centered around the skull and feet. Many akin the practice to an alternative to reike.</h2>
        <h2 class="about-text5">According to <a href= "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17677-craniosacral-therapy">Clevland Medical Clinic</a>, CST can help alleviate pain from the following conditions:</h2>

        <h2>About Heather</h2>
        <p>
          Heather previously worked for a behavioral health services company located in Sebastopol, California. From the time she was young, and from her time working in Sebastopol, she discovered a passion for inner energy work. She enjoys meeting people and helping them become more in touch with themselves.
          <br> <br>
          After her time working in Sebastopol, she moved into a similar industry: holistic health. She worked for a small, friend-run acupuncturist office as she began a three-year certification program in BCST. 
          <br> <br>
          She is interested in building her own practice and working with all people who might be interested in inner work.
