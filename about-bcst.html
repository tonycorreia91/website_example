          BCST is a healing art that works with the energies that create and maintain health in the human system. While not a manipulative therapy, it has its roots in osteopathy and has evolved to include influences from human development, pre and perinatal psychology, trauma resolution, and recent advances in neuroscience. BCST supports nervous system regulation and allows the resolution of conditions resulting from stress and trauma. Practitioners use an educated, gentle, non-invasive touch  to engage with the expressions of health in the system.

        Dr. John Upledger began to teach something he called CranioSacral Therapy in the 1970’s. Dr. Upledger brought this work out in a particular form and framework. His endeavors have been paramount in the creation of a defined craniosacral profession and practice outside of the osteopathic framework. His work is taught all over the world by the Upledger Institute.</h2>

        <h2 class="hm-about-text">1970s</h2>
        <h2 class="about-text5"> 
        In 1975-1979 Franklyn Sills, with a group of other enthusiastic students, studied the work of Dr. Randolph Stone DO. Sills was fascinated by what Stone called primary energy and the neuter essence. He discovered that Sutherland was a major influence on Stone in this venue. A connection with Polarity Therapy is still a strong current in the Biodynamic Craniosacral community.
        <br> <br>
        In 1982, Sills moved to England and co-created the Karuna Institute in Devon. During this time, he undertook an osteopathic training and underwent an apprenticeship in a busy London practice. One of the osteopaths in the practice was a cranial practitioner and greatly influenced Franklyn’s work. Franklyn was encouraged to enter a receptive state, to orient to what was called the tidal potency and the fluid tide, and wait for the potency of the Breath of Life to manifest its healing intentions.</h2>

        <h2 class="about-text5"> 
        In 1986, Claire Dolby DO encouraged Franklyn to begin teaching a form of cranial work outside of the osteopathic profession. The first cranial training developed by Sills was taught at the Karuna Institute in 1986, assisted by Claire. It was a mixed biomechanical and biodynamic program where people learned biomechanical language and technique and were then encouraged to deepen into the more formative forces of primary respiration.
        <br> <br>
        It soon became clear that this mixed approach did not serve the teaching staff’s intention to orient students to the deeper organizing forces in the human system. At a group meeting of tutors at Karuna in 1992, everyone present agreed that they wanted to begin to teach what they were actually practiced.

        <h2 class="about-text5"> 
        Over a period of years, it is the practitioner’s task to deepen perceptual clarity, grow in relational skills, and increase appreciation of the presence of both primary respiration and the conditional forces and patterns held within the system.
        <br> <br>
        The hallmark of a biodynamic craniosacral approach is a direct orientation to the universal and conditional forces of life. In this approach, the practitioner:
        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Settles into a still and receptive state of being.</li>
          <li>Clearly negotiates a relationship with the client and their system.</li>
          <li>Orients to the presence of primary respiration.</li>    
          <li>Waits for a shift within the client’s system to this formative ordering force.</li>
          <li>Creates a container within which decisions are made by the Breath of life and the primary respiration it generates.</li>
